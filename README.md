### Project Description:

The input can consist of either Arabic or Roman numerals, followed by a space, a mathematical operation sign (+, -, *, /), another space, and a digit. All numbers should be between 0 and 10 (inclusive). If the input data does not match the specified format, an exception is thrown.

The main objective of this project is to convert the input numbers to their corresponding Arabic or Roman representations, based on the given input. The project supports the four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). After performing the requested operation, the project returns the result as either an Arabic or Roman numeral, depending on the input data.

Key Features:
- Supports arithmetic operations on Roman and Arabic numerals
- Handles inputs in the format: "4 + 7" or "IV + VII"
- Validates input data and throws exceptions for invalid formats
- Returns the result as an Arabic or Roman numeral based on the input
